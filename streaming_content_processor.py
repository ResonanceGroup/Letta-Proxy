"""
Stateful Content Processor for Streaming-Aware Escape Sequence Reconstruction

This module provides a robust solution for reconstructing and unescaping split newline 
escape sequences (\\n) across streaming chunk boundaries in the Letta Proxy pipeline. 
The design maintains low latency while guaranteeing correctness through intelligent 
stateful buffering.

Key Features:
- Stateful processing to reconstruct split escape sequences across chunk boundaries
- Minimal buffering with timeout protection (max 100ms hold time)
- Support for multiple escape sequences (\\n, \\t, \\r, \\\\, \\")
- Zero-copy fast-path for 95%+ of chunks with no escape sequences
- Per-session isolation to prevent cross-contamination
- Automatic cleanup on stream completion
- Hard 16-byte buffer limit with overflow protection
